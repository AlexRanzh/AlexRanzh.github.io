Decision FunctionA function $f(x)$ that maps a sample point to a scalar value that$$f(x)&gt;0 if x \\in class Cf(x)\\leq if x not \\in class C$$ For these decision function, the decision boundary is $f(x)=0$, usually a (d-1) dimensional surface in $R^d$.

First-order Markov Transition Model Let $(X_1, X_2, …, X_n)$ be a sequence of discrete random variables that take value from ${1,2,…,K}$ with K fixed. first-order finite value Markov chainThe sequence is said to be a first-order finite value Markov chain if$$P(X_{n+1}=j|X_0=x_0,X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,…,X_{n-1}=x_{n-1},X_n = i) = P(X_{n+1}=j|X_n = i)$$for all $n, x_0,x_1, …, x_{n-1}$ and $i,j$ such that $1\\leq i,j \\leq K$. transition probabilityTransition probability $p_n$ is defined as$$p_{n}(i,j)=P(X_n=j|X_{n-1}=i)$$ transition matrixTransition matrix $P$ is defined as a $K \\times K$ matrix such that$$P_n[i,j] = p_{n}(i,j)$$ structural zeroesIf it is certain that no transition will be made from i to j in the $n$th period, then set $p_n(i,j)=0$, this is called a structural zero. ###Propagation of Markov ChainIf we know the transition matrix from period $n-r$ to $n$, i.e. $P_r,P_{r+1},…,P_{n-1}$ are known, then we also be able to know the state in the $n$th period:$$Prob(X_{n}=j|X_{n-r}=i) = P_{n-r+1}P_{n-r+2}…P_{n}[i,j]$$for any $1\\leq r \\leq n$ Forcasting from state 0:$$Prob(X_{n}=j|X_{0}=i) = P_{1}P_{2}…P_{n}[i,j]$$let $\\pi_{i}$ be the marginal distribution for $X_n$:$$\\pi_n = (P(X_n = 1),P(X_n = 2),…,P(X_n = K))^T$$ Then,$$\\pi_n = \\pi_0(P_1 P_2 … P_n)$$ Stationary Markov Chain stationaryA Markov chain is stationary if $p_n(i,j)=p(i,j)$ for all $n,\\ and\\ i,j\\ where 1\\leq i, j \\leq K$, for some transition probability $p$. stationary distributionA stationary distribution for transition matrix is a distribution $\\pi^\\star = \\pi^\\star P$. In practice, most Markov chains converge (with 𝑛) to a stationarydistribution.(Markov chains which have a periodicity in state change do not necessarily converge, but we do not cover this material in this course). EstimationThe aim this section, given some data, is to estimate $\\mathbf{\\theta}=(\\theta_{ij})^{K}{i,j=1}$ where $\\theta{ij}=p(i,j)$.Maximum likelihood estimator for $\\mathbf{\\theta}$:$$\\hat\\theta_{ij}=\\hat p(i,j)=\\frac{n_{ij}}{\\sum_{l=1}^{n}n_{il}}$$where $n_{ij}=|{t:x_{t-1}=i,x_{t}=j,\\ for \\ t\\in {1,2,…,n}}|$, i.e. total number of observations that move from state $i$ to state $j$ during period 1 to n.proof 2017Q1(c) Derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the first order finite-valued Markov transition model, assuming stationarity. likelihood function $P(X_0=x_0,X_1=x_1,…,X_n=x_n)$$=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P(X_{t}=x_t|X_{t-1}=x_{t-1},X_{t-2}=x_{t-2},…,X_{1}=x_{1})P(X_0=x_0)$$=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P(X_{t}=x_t|X_{t-1}=x_{t-1})P(X_0=x_0)(Chain rule)$$=P(X_0=x_0)\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P(X_{t}=x_t|X_{t-1}=x_{t-1})$$=P(X_0=x_0)\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\prod_{j=1}^{n}[p(i,j)]^{n_{ij}}$$=P(X_0=x_0)\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\prod_{j=1}^{n}[\\theta_{ij}]^{n_{ij}}$$$where\\ n_{ij}=|{t:x_t=x_t,X_{t-1}=x_{t-1},\\ for\\ t\\in {1,…,n}}|$$ log likelihood function differentiate and find MLE adjust to constraints Testing First-order AssumptionsIn order to test if first order markov chain is a suitable assumption in each occasion,we use chi-square hypothesis test. second order Markov chainA sequence (x_1,..,x_n) is a second order Markov chain if$P(x_n+1=j|X_0=x_0,…,X_{n-1}=k,X_{n}=i)=P(x_n+1=j|X_{n-1}=k,X_{n}=i)$ The transition probability$p_n(k,i,j)=P(X_n=i, X_{n-1}=k)$ The MLE for a second-Markov chain can similarly be proved as:$\\hat p(k,i,j)=\\hat\\theta_{kij}=\\frac{n_kij}{mki}$where $n_{kij}=|{t:x_{t-2}=k,x_{t-1}=i,x_{t}=j\\ for\\ t \\in {2,…,n}}|,m_{ki}=|{t:x_{t-2}=k,x_{t-1}=i\\ for\\ t \\in {2,…,n}}|=\\sum_{l=i}^{n}n_{kil}$ $H_{0}$Null hypothesis:$P(1,i,j)=P(2,i,j)=…=P(K,i,j)=P(i,j)$where $P(k,i,j)$ is second-order Markov transition probability from state k to i then to j. $n_k$$n_k=|{t:x_t=k\\ for\\ t \\in {1,..,n}}|$i.e. The observed number of times for each states $O_{kj}$The observed number of times state k follwed by i and then j$O_{kj}=n{kij}=m_{ki}\\hat p(i,j)$ $E_{kj}$The expected number of times state $k$ is followed by state $i$ and then $j$, given null hypothesis is:$E_{kj}=n_{k}\\hat p(k,i)\\hat p(i,j)\\approx m_{ki}\\hat p(i,j)$becuase $\\hat p(k,i)=\\frac{n_{ki}}{\\sum_{l=1}^{K}n_{kl}}\\approx \\frac{m_{ki}}{n_k}$ Pearson Chi_square test$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{k\\in S_1}\\sum_{k\\in S_2}\\frac{(O_{kj}-E{kj})^2}{E_{kj}}$$ S1 is the set of states which do not have a structural zero moving to state $i$ S2 is the set of states which do not have a structural zero moving from state $i$ Degree of freedom$df = (K-1-z_{1})(K-1-z_{2})$ $z_1$: the number of structural zeroes in the transition from $k$ to $i$. $z_2$: the number of structural zeroes in the transition from $i$ to $j$.

Chapter 7: Fraud Detection in Retail CreditTypes of Fraud: Theft Counterfeit Application Card-not-present/online Automated Fraud DetectionThis essentially is a classification problem, legitimate transaction Y=1, illegal Y=0. Special problems for fraud detection (that distinguish it from other classification problems) 2017 Q3(a) What special characteristics does fraud detection have, considered as a classification problem?∗ Need to process millions of transactions in real time.∗ Highly imbalanced classification problem: ratio of fraudulent to legitimatetransactions is typically very small.∗ Nature of fraud is reflexive. That is, fraudsters adapt to the detection methods applied by banks to stop them. High volume data. Data highly imbalanced. Reflexive nature. difference of fraud detection problem from application model? Do not need to explain the model, so nonlinear complicated models are allowed. Business Rule method For example, the card is used abroadand it had not been used in the past year in the countryand the card holder did not tell the bank they will be abroad Predictive Model methodConstruct a two-class classifier - a fraud scorecard. the higher the score, the more trustworthy the account is. classifier model with function $f$: $\\hat{y} = f(x,\\theta)$, and estimate $\\theta$ with data x. filter out some legitimate transaction to balance training data set. e.g. discard small amount transactions, regular transactions and inactive accounts.past research have shown that a linear model is not enough, non-linear classifiers like ANN works better. This method works well in detecting known type fraudulent transactions, but not able to deal with new fraud types. Anomaly Detection methodAnother method is to model only the legal transactions and detect any abnormal new transactions. Comparing with predictive modelling: pros: it can detect new types of fraud it do not worry about the imbalanced data(coz 1)con: it is not as sensible to transactions that are similar to legitimate ones One-class classifier only model legitimate pdf over predictor variables 2017Q3(b) What are the key differences between one-class and two-class classifiers for fraud?∗ Two-class classifiers are modelling the difference between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.∗ One-class classifiers just model distribution of legitimate transactions.∗ One-class classifiers are well-suited to deal with the reflexivity of fraud, since they do not explicitly model the existing pattern of fraud. Steps for Anomaly Detection: drop out abnormal transactions: fraudulent transactions, errors, genuine but outliers Let $S = (\\mathbf{x_{1}},\\mathbf{x_{2}},…,\\mathbf{x_{n}})$ be a training sequence of legitimate transactions. estimate $f(\\mathbf{x}|S,\\gamma)$ where $\\gamma$ is an estimation parameter. A classification decision is made with a new observation $\\mathbf{x_{new}}$ at:$$\\hat(y) = I(f(\\mathbf{x_{new}}|S,\\gamma)&gt;\\theta)$$where $\\theta$ is a threshold in probability. 2017Q3(e) Which of these will register a fraud alert, based on your result in part (d)?ANS: T2 and T3 have density less than θ = 0.05 and so will register a fraud alert. The threshold $\\theta$ is manually set based on the (sensible) strategy of controlling the fraction $\\epsilon$ of legitimate cases to be classified as anomalous, based on training data.—- This is constrained by how many false alert is generated/business resource can be input to followups. 2017 Q3(d) Given a false alarm rate ε = 1/8, and based only on this data, what is the value of θ?ANS:Use formula $$max \\theta s.t. \\sum^{n}_{i=1}I(f(x_i) &gt; \\theta) \\leq n(1 − \\epsilon)$$where $$n(1 − \\epsilon) = 24 × 7/8 = 21$$Therefore, count lowest (24 − 21) = 3 densities from the table gives $\\theta$ = 0.05. i.e.$$min\\theta s.t. \\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}|S,\\gamma)&gt;\\theta)=floor(n\\epsilon)$$ Kernel Density EstimatorCrude empirical density:$$\\hat{F_{EMP}}= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(x_{i}\\leqslant x)$$ kernel density function: 2017Q3(c) Describe Parzen density estimation. $$\\hat{f(x)} = \\frac{1}{nh^m}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} K(\\frac{x-x_{i}}{h})$$s.t. $K(z) = K(-z)$ $\\int K(z) dz = 1$ $\\mathbf{x_1}, \\mathbf{x_2}, …, \\mathbf{x_n}$ is observations with dimension m h is bandwidth constant Available data Account Data Transaction Data Personal Data Location data Social Network AnalysisUsing weight $w_{ij}$ to estimate association feature/degree of connectedness to fraud people $F_{i}$ and hence have fraud propensity from it. 2017Q3(f) Describe in words what Fi is measuring?(f) Variable $F_{i}$ measures the degree of connectedness to other people committing fraud.

Today’s Objectives EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) Use pyhton Pandas to do EDA Tabular DataDS100 Textbook: Tabular Data The first thing to do when we have a new data set in hand is to look at its inside. Data can be structured in different ways:1.1 Comma-Separated Values (CSV)[example]1.2 Tab-Separated Values (TSV)2.1 JavaScript Object Format (JSON)[curly brackets]3.1 eXtensible Markup Language (XML)[how websites store info]3.2 HyperText Markup Language (HTML) CSV and TSV data is structured in a tabular structure, in rows and columns.JSON, XML, HTML data has a hierarchical structure, like a tree.(see Hokodo intern note for JSON processing methods) Check file format: right click and view profile fancier way:use command-line interface (CLI) tools/terminal1ls or if you are in Jupyter notebook:1!ls !+command line in Jupyter Although all these data formats are often used, CSV is often the easiest and most frequently used structure. Before reading data, need to figure out how much memory it is going to take. 1234!ls -l -h folder!du -h folder#specific file usage!du -sh folder/* As a rule of thumb, reading in a file of x GB requires 4x GB memory. Pandas needs 2x but has to share memory with other programs. Memory OverheadNote that memory is shared by all programs running on a computer, including the operating system, web browsers, and yes, Jupyter notebook itself. A computer with 4 GiB total RAM might have only 1 GiB available RAM with many applications running. With 1 GiB available RAM, it is unlikely that pandas will be able to read in a 1 GiB file.

if (_onErrorHandlerInstalled) &#123; // 一个起到标志作用的全局变量 return; &#125; _oldOnerrorHandler = _window.onerror; // _oldOnerrorHandler 是防止对用户其他地方定义的回调函数进行覆盖 // 该 _window 经过兼容，实际上就是 window _window.onerror = traceKitWindowOnError; _onErrorHandlerInstalled = true;&#125; 相关错误回调函数交给 traceKitWindowOnError 处理，下面我们来看一下 traceKitWindowOnError 函数，为了避免太多冗余代码，我们仅分析一种主要情况： 1234567891011121314function traceKitWindowOnError(msg, url, lineNo, colNo, ex) &#123; var exception = utils.isErrorEvent(ex) ? ex.error : ex; //... stack = TraceKit.computeStackTrace(exception); notifyHandlers(stack, true); //... //... if (_oldOnerrorHandler) &#123; return _oldOnerrorHandler.apply(this, arguments); &#125; return false;&#125; 其中调用的最重要的一个函数，就是 computeStackTrace，而这个函数也是 TraceKit 的核心函数，简单来讲，它做的事情就是统一格式化报错信息调用栈，因为对于各个浏览器来说，返回的 Error 调用栈信息格式不尽相同，另外甚至还有的浏览器并不返回调用栈，computeStackTrace 函数对这些情况都做了兼容性处理，并且对于一些不返回调用栈的情况，还使用了 caller 来向上回溯函数的调用栈，最终把报错信息转化成一个键相同的对象数组，做到了报错信息格式的统一。 notifyHandlers 函数则是通知相关的回调函数。 实际上，raven.js 在 install 函数中会调用 TraceKit.report.subscribe 函数，并把对错误的处理逻辑写入回调： 1234function subscribe(handler) &#123; installGlobalHandler(); handlers.push(handler);&#125; 以上过程完成了错误处理过程中的负责角色转换，并且借助 TraceKit，可以使 raven.js 得到一个结构比较清晰的带有格式化好的调用栈信息的错误内容对象，之后，raven.js 对错误内容进一步处理并最终上报。 下面我们对错误处理 raven.js 控制的部分做了一些梳理： 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101 _handleOnErrorStackInfo: function(stackInfo, options) &#123; options.mechanism = options.mechanism || &#123; type: &apos;onerror&apos;, handled: false &#125;; // mechanism 和错误统计来源有关 if (!this._ignoreOnError) &#123; this._handleStackInfo(stackInfo, options); &#125;&#125;,_handleStackInfo: function(stackInfo, options) &#123; var frames = this._prepareFrames(stackInfo, options); this._triggerEvent(&apos;handle&apos;, &#123; stackInfo: stackInfo, options: options &#125;); this._processException( stackInfo.name, stackInfo.message, stackInfo.url, stackInfo.lineno, frames, options );&#125;,_processException: function(type, message, fileurl, lineno, frames, options) &#123; // 首先根据 message 信息判断是否是需要忽略的错误类型 // 然后判断出错的文件是否在黑名单中或者白名单中 // 接下来对错误内容进行必要的整合与转换，构造出 data 对象 // 最后调用上报函数 this._send(data);&#125;_send: function(data) &#123; // 对 data 进一步处理，增加必要的信息，包括后续会提到的面包屑信息 // 交由 _sendProcessedPayload 进行进一步处理 this._sendProcessedPayload(data);&#125;_sendProcessedPayload: function(data, callback) &#123; // 对 data 增加一些必要的元信息 // 可以通过自定义 globalOptions.transport 的方式来自定义上报函数 (globalOptions.transport || this._makeRequest).call(this, &#123; url: url, auth: auth, data: data, options: globalOptions, onSuccess: function success() &#123; &#125;, onError: function failure(error) &#123; &#125; &#125;);&#125; // 真正发起请求的函数_makeRequest: function(opts) &#123; // 对于支持 fetch 的浏览器，直接使用 fetch 的方式发送 POST 请求 // 如果浏览器不支持 fetch，则使用 XHR 的传统方式发送 POST 请求&#125;``` 实际上我们可以发现，从拿到已经初步格式化的报错信息，到最终真正执行数据上报，raven.js 的过程非常漫长，这其中我分析有如下几个原因：* 每个函数只处理一件或者一些事情，保持函数的短小整洁。* 部分函数可以做到复用（因为除了自动捕获错误的方式， raven.js 还提供通过 captureException，即 `try &#123; doSomething(a[0])&#125; catch(e) &#123; Raven.captureException(e)&#125;` 的方式来上报错误，两个过程中有一些函数的调用是有重叠的）。但是笔者认为，raven.js 的代码设计还有很多值得优化的地方，比如：* 对最终上报数据（data）的属性处理和增加分散在多个函数，并且有较多可选项目，很难梳理出一个完整的 data 格式，并且不便于维护。* 部分函数的拆分必要性不足，并且会增加链路的复杂性，比如 `_processException `、`_sendProcessedPayload `、`_makeRequest `等都只在一个链路中被调用一次。* 部分属性重命名会造成资源浪费，由于 TraceKit 部分最终返回的数据格式并不完全满足 raven.js 的需要，所以 raven.js 之后又在较后阶段进行了重命名等处理，实际上这些内容完全可以通过一些其他的方式避免。最后，非常遗憾，sentry 目前完全不支持合并上报，就算是在同一个事件循环（甚至事件循环的同一个阶段，关于事件循环，可以参考我之前绘制的[一张图](https://www.processon.com/view/link/5b6ec8cbe4b053a09c2fb977)）的两个错误，sentry 都是分开来上报的，这里有一个简单例子：```javascriptRaven.config(&apos;http://8ec3f1a9f652463bb58191bd0b35f20c@localhost:9000/2&apos;).install()let s = window.ss;try&#123; let b = s.b&#125; catch (e) &#123; Raven.captureException(e) // sentry should report error now&#125;s.nomethod();// sentry should report error now 以上例子中，sentry 会发送两个 POST 请求。 raven.js 最终上报数据的格式这一部分，我们并不会详细地分析 raven.js 上报的数据的每一项内容，仅会给读者展示一个比较典型的情况。 我们看一下对于一个一般的 js 错误，raven.js 上报的 json 中包含哪些内容，下面是一个已经删掉一些冗余内容的典型上报信息： 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051&#123;

var proto = _window[global] &amp;&amp; _window[global].prototype; if (proto &amp;&amp; proto.hasOwnProperty &amp;&amp; proto.hasOwnProperty('addEventListener')) &#123; fill( proto, 'addEventListener', function(orig) &#123; return function(evtName, fn, capture, secure) &#123; try &#123; if (fn &amp;&amp; fn.handleEvent) &#123; //兼容通过 handleEvent 的方式进行绑定事件 fn.handleEvent = self.wrap( &#123; mechanism: &#123; type: 'instrument', data: &#123; target: global, function: 'handleEvent', handler: (fn &amp;&amp; fn.name) || '&lt;anonymous&gt;' &#125; &#125; &#125;, fn.handleEvent ); &#125; &#125; catch (err) &#123; &#125; var before, clickHandler, keypressHandler; if ( autoBreadcrumbs &amp;&amp; autoBreadcrumbs.dom &amp;&amp; (global === 'EventTarget' || global === 'Node') ) &#123; // NOTE: generating multiple handlers per addEventListener invocation, should // revisit and verify we can just use one (almost certainly) clickHandler = self._breadcrumbEventHandler('click'); keypressHandler = self._keypressEventHandler(); before = function(evt) &#123; // 钩子函数，用于在回调函数调用的时候记录信息 if (!evt) return; var eventType; try &#123; eventType = evt.type; &#125; catch (e) &#123; // just accessing event properties can throw an exception in some rare circumstances // see: https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/issues/838 return; &#125; if (eventType === 'click') return clickHandler(evt); else if (eventType === 'keypress') return keypressHandler(evt); &#125;; &#125; return orig.call( this, evtName, self.wrap( &#123; mechanism: &#123; type: 'instrument', data: &#123; target: global, function: 'addEventListener', handler: (fn &amp;&amp; fn.name) || '&lt;anonymous&gt;' &#125; &#125; &#125;, fn, before ), capture, secure ); &#125;; &#125;, wrappedBuiltIns ); fill( proto, 'removeEventListener', function(orig) &#123; return function(evt, fn, capture, secure) &#123; try &#123; fn = fn &amp;&amp; (fn.__raven_wrapper__ ? fn.__raven_wrapper__ : fn); &#125; catch (e) &#123; // ignore, accessing __raven_wrapper__ will throw in some Selenium environments &#125; return orig.call(this, evt, fn, capture, secure); &#125;; &#125;, wrappedBuiltIns ); &#125; &#125; 以上代码兼容了通过 handleEvent 的方式进行绑定事件（如果没有听说过这种方式，可以在这里补充一些相关的知识）。 默认情况下，raven.js 只记录通过 EventTarget.addEventListener 绑定的点击和输入信息，实际上这是比较科学的，并且这些信息较为有效。另外，raven.js 也提供了记录所有点击和输入信息的可选项，其实现方式更为简单，直接在 document 上添加相关的监听即可。 raven.js 如何和框架配合使用raven.js 和框架配合使用的方式非常简单，但是我们要知道，很多框架内置了错误边界处理，或者对错误进行转义。以至于我们通过 window.onerror 的方式得不到完整的错误信息。同时，有些框架提供了错误处理的接口（比如 vue），利用错误处理的接口，我们能够获取到和错误有关的更多更重要的信息。 raven.js 利用各个框架的官方接口，提供了 vue、require.js、angular、ember、react-native 等各个框架的官方插件。 插件内容本身非常简单，我们可以看一下 vue 插件的代码： 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142function formatComponentName(vm) &#123; if (vm.$root === vm) &#123; return &apos;root instance&apos;; &#125; var name = vm._isVue ? vm.$options.name || vm.$options._componentTag : vm.name; return ( (name ? &apos;component &lt;&apos; + name + &apos;&gt;&apos; : &apos;anonymous component&apos;) + (vm._isVue &amp;&amp; vm.$options.__file ? &apos; at &apos; + vm.$options.__file : &apos;&apos;) );&#125;function vuePlugin(Raven, Vue) &#123; Vue = Vue || window.Vue; // quit if Vue isn&apos;t on the page if (!Vue || !Vue.config) return; var _oldOnError = Vue.config.errorHandler; Vue.config.errorHandler = function VueErrorHandler(error, vm, info) &#123; var metaData = &#123;&#125;; // vm and lifecycleHook are not always available if (Object.prototype.toString.call(vm) === &apos;[object Object]&apos;) &#123; metaData.componentName = formatComponentName(vm); metaData.propsData = vm.$options.propsData; &#125; if (typeof info !== &apos;undefined&apos;) &#123; metaData.lifecycleHook = info; &#125; Raven.captureException(error, &#123; extra: metaData &#125;); if (typeof _oldOnError === &apos;function&apos;) &#123; _oldOnError.call(this, error, vm, info); &#125; &#125;;&#125;module.exports = vuePlugin; 应该不用进行过多解释。 你也许想知道为什么没有提供 react 插件，事实上，react 16 以后才引入了Error Boundaries，这种方式由于灵活性太强，并不太适合使用插件，另外，就算不使用插件，也非常方便地使用 raven.js 进行错误上报，可以参考这里 但笔者认为，目前 react 的引入方式会对源代码进行侵入，并且比较难通过构建的方式进行 sentry 的配置，也许我们可以寻找更好的方式。 完。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"javascript","slug":"javascript","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/javascript/"},{"name":"前端监控","slug":"前端监控","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/前端监控/"}]},{"title":"Lagrangian Mechanics and Rigid Body Motion","slug":"Lagrangian Mechanics and Heavy-top Motion","date":"2018-06-20T10:23:09.000Z","updated":"2019-04-15T00:17:48.441Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/06/20/Lagrangian Mechanics and Heavy-top Motion/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/06/20/Lagrangian Mechanics and Heavy-top Motion/","excerpt":"","text":"This is a group research project I did in my second year at Imperial College London as a math undergraduate student.

We will investigate the effect of removing the gravitational field (in the case of the Spherical Pendulum) and discuss any links between the two, as well as any implications of the solutions. A rigid body is a collection of N points such that the distance between any two of them is fixed regardless of any external forces they are subject to. We shall look at the kinematics, the Inertia Tensor and Euler’s Equation and use this to explain about the dynamical stability of rigid bodies. Symmetric tops are the main example that we will investigate and discuss. We will look into the precession rate and the spinning rate and discuss two examples, Feynman’s wobbling plate and the hula hoop.

We found that two-way data bindings lead to cascading updates, where changing one data model led to another data model updating, making it very difficult to predict what would change as the result of a single user interaction.总而言之，Flux对我们来说效果很好，因为单向数据流可以让应用程序变得更加复杂，从而轻松理解和修改应用程序。我们发现双向数据绑定导致级联更新，其中更改一个数据模型导致另一个数据模型更新，使得很难预测单个用户交互的结果会发生什么变化。 从此之后，下面这张图便多次出现在官方博客和各个网站中，相信我们也肯定见过下图： react-router2014年8月，react-router 的雏形发布，在其发布之前，不少示例应用还在使用 backbone.js 的 router，而 react-router 的发布，标志着 react 生态的进一步成熟。 react ES6 Class实际上，在 2015.01.27 之前，我们都是在使用 React.createClass来书写组件。 而在 2015.01.27 这一天，也就是第一届 reactjs conf 的前一天，react 官方发布了 React V0.13.0 beta 版本。这一个版本的最大更新就是支持 ES6 的 Class 写法来书写组件，同时也公布了比如 propTypes 类型检查、defaultProps、AutoBind、ref 等一系列相关工作在 ES6 Class 模式下的写法。 这次发布是 react 开源至此最为重大的一次更新，也因此直接将 react 的写法进行了革新，在我看来，这标志着 react 从刀耕火种的原始时代进入了石器时代。 实际上，直到一个半月后的 03.10 ，V0.13 的正式版本才发布。 而在之后的 V15.5 版本（2017年4月发布），react 才将React.createClass的使用设置为 Deprecation，并且宣布会在将来移除该 API，与此同时，react 团队仍然提供了一个单独的库create-react-class 来支持原来的 React.createClass 功能。 Relay &amp; GraphQL在 2015 年的 2月，Facebook 公布了 GraphQL，GraphQL 是一种新的数据查询解决方案，事实证明，它是非常优秀的一个解决方案，到现在已经基本在行业内人尽皆知。 而 Relay 则是链接 react 和 GraphQL 的一个解决方案，有点类似 redux（但是 stat 数只有 redux 的四分之一左右），但是对 GraphQL 更为友好，并且在缓存机制的设计（按照 Graph 来 cache）、声明式的数据获取等方面，有一些自己的独到之处。 当然，我们使用 redux 配合相关插件，也可以不使用 Relay。 React Native在第一届 React.js Conf 中，react 团队首次公开了 React Native，并且在3月份真正开源了 React Native（实际上这个时候安卓版本还并不可用），之后在2015年上半年，相关团队陆陆续续披露了关于 React Native 发展情况的更多信息。 并且也是在这个时候（2015年3月），react 团队开始使用 learn once, write anywhere 这个如今我们耳熟能详的口号。 react &amp; react-dom &amp; babel在2015年七月，官方发布了React v0.14 Beta 1，这也是一个变动比较大的版本，在这个版本中，主要有如下比较大的变化: 官方宣布废弃 react-tools 和 JSTransform，这是和 JSX 解析相关的库，而从此 react 开始使用 babel，我认为这对 react 以及其使用者来说无疑是一个利好。 分离 react 和 react-dom，由于 React Native 已经迭代了一段时间，这个分离同时也意味着 react 之后的发展方向，react 本身将会关注抽象层和组件本身，而 react-dom 可以将其在浏览器中落地，React Native 可以将其在客户端中落地，之后也许还会有 react-xxx … 将 react 和 react-dom 分离之后，react 团队又对 react-dom 在 dom 方面做了较为大量的更新。 Discontinuing IE 8 Support在 react V15 的版本中，放弃了对 IE 8 的支持。 Fiberreact 团队使用 Fiber 架构完成了 react V16 的开发，得益于 Fiber 架构，react 的性能又得到了显著提升（尤其是在某些要求交互连续的场景下），并且包大小缩小了 32%。 到目前来说，关于 Fiber 架构的中英文资料都已经相当丰富，笔者在这里就不进行过多的赘述了。 接下来的展望react 团队目前的主要工作集中在 async rendering 方面，这方面的改进可以极大提升用户交互体验（特别是在弱网络环境下），会在 2018 年发布。 如果你对这方面的内容很感兴趣，不妨看看 react 之前的演讲视频 附录1 一些你可能不知道的变化 react并非直接将 JSX 渲染成 DOM，而是对某些事件和属性做了封装（优化）。 react 对表单类型的 DOM 进行了优化，比如封装了较为通用的 onChange 回调函数，这其中需要处理不少问题，react 在 V0.4 即拥有了这一特性，可以参考这里 事实上，react 在V0.8之前，一直在以“react-tools”这个名字发布，而 npm 上面叫做 react 的实际上是另外一个包，而到 V0.8 的时候，react 团队和原来的 “react” 包开发者协商，之后 react 便接管了原来的这个包，也因此，react并没有 V0.6 和 V0.7，而是从 V0.5 直接到了 V0.8 react 从 V0.14 之后，就直接跳跃到了 V15，官方团队给出的理由是，react 很早就已经足够稳定并且可以使用在生产版本中，更改版本的表达方式更有助于表示 react 项目本身的稳定性。 附录2 一些比较优秀的博客 关于React Components, Elements, 和 Instances，如果你还有一些疑问，可以看一看React官方团队的文章：React Components, Elements, and Instances 如果你倾向于使用 mixins，不妨看看 react 关于取消 mixin的说法：Mixins Considered Harmful react props 相关的开发模式的建议，我认为目前在使用 react 的程序员都应该了解一下You Probably Don’t Need Derived State","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"react","slug":"react","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/react/"}]},{"title":"十条编写优化的 JavaScript 代码的建议","slug":"十条编写优化的JavaScript代码的建议","date":"2018-05-29T07:59:40.000Z","updated":"2019-04-15T00:17:48.443Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/05/29/十条编写优化的JavaScript代码的建议/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/05/29/十条编写优化的JavaScript代码的建议/","excerpt":"","text":"本文总结了十条编写优秀的 JavaScript 代码的习惯，主要针对 V8 引擎： 1.始终以相同的顺序实例化对象属性，以便可以共享隐藏类和随后优化的代码。V8 在对 js 代码解析的时候会有构建隐藏类的过程，以相同的顺序实例化（属性赋值）的对象会共享相同的隐藏类。下面给出一个不好的实践： 1234567891011function Point(x, y) &#123;

上面代码生成了一段32字节的内存区域，每个字节的值默认都是0。可以看到，ArrayBuffer构造函数的参数是所需要的内存大小（单位字节）。 为了读写这段内容，需要为它指定视图。DataView视图的创建，需要提供ArrayBuffer对象实例作为参数。 123var buf = new ArrayBuffer(32);var dataView = new DataView(buf);dataView.getUint8(0) // 0 上面代码对一段32字节的内存，建立DataView视图，然后以不带符号的8位整数格式，读取第一个元素，结果得到0，因为原始内存的ArrayBuffer对象，默认所有位都是0。 另外，我们可以将ArrayBuffer生成的结果，传入TypedArray中： 12345678var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(12);var x1 = new Int32Array(buffer);x1[0] = 1;var x2 = new Uint8Array(buffer);x2[0] = 2;x1[0] // 2 ArrayBuffer实例的byteLength属性，返回所分配的内存区域的字节长度。 123var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(32);buffer.byteLength// 32 如果要分配的内存区域很大，有可能分配失败（因为没有那么多的连续空余内存），所以有必要检查是否分配成功。 12345if (buffer.byteLength === n) &#123; // 成功&#125; else &#123; // 失败&#125; ArrayBuffer实例有一个slice方法，允许将内存区域的一部分，拷贝生成一个新的ArrayBuffer对象。 12var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);var newBuffer = buffer.slice(0, 3); 上面代码拷贝buffer对象的前3个字节（从0开始，到第3个字节前面结束），生成一个新的ArrayBuffer对象。slice方法其实包含两步，第一步是先分配一段新内存，第二步是将原来那个ArrayBuffer对象拷贝过去。 slice方法接受两个参数，第一个参数表示拷贝开始的字节序号（含该字节），第二个参数表示拷贝截止的字节序号（不含该字节）。如果省略第二个参数，则默认到原ArrayBuffer对象的结尾。 除了slice方法，ArrayBuffer对象不提供任何直接读写内存的方法，只允许在其上方建立视图，然后通过视图读写。 ArrayBuffer有一个静态方法isView，返回一个布尔值，表示参数是否为ArrayBuffer的视图实例。这个方法大致相当于判断参数，是否为TypedArray实例或DataView实例。 12345var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);ArrayBuffer.isView(buffer) // falsevar v = new Int32Array(buffer);ArrayBuffer.isView(v) // true TypedArray目前，TypedArray对象一共提供9种类型的视图，每一种视图都是一种构造函数。 Int8Array：8位有符号整数，长度1个字节。 Uint8Array：8位无符号整数，长度1个字节。 Uint8ClampedArray：8位无符号整数，长度1个字节，溢出处理不同。 Int16Array：16位有符号整数，长度2个字节。 Uint16Array：16位无符号整数，长度2个字节。 Int32Array：32位有符号整数，长度4个字节。 Uint32Array：32位无符号整数，长度4个字节。 Float32Array：32位浮点数，长度4个字节。 Float64Array：64位浮点数，长度8个字节。 这9个构造函数生成的对象，统称为TypedArray对象。它们很像正常数组，都有length属性，都能用方括号运算符（[]）获取单个元素，所有数组的方法，在类型化数组上面都能使用。两者的差异主要在以下方面。 TypedArray数组的所有成员，都是同一种类型和格式。 TypedArray数组的成员是连续的，不会有空位。 Typed化数组成员的默认值为0。比如，new Array(10)返回一个正常数组，里面没有任何成员，只是10个空位；new Uint8Array(10)返回一个类型化数组，里面10个成员都是0。 TypedArray数组只是一层视图，本身不储存数据，它的数据都储存在底层的ArrayBuffer对象之中，要获取底层对象必须使用buffer属性。 构造函数TypedArray数组提供9种构造函数，用来生成相应类型的数组实例。 构造函数有多种用法。 TypedArray(buffer, byteOffset=0, length?) 同一个ArrayBuffer对象之上，可以根据不同的数据类型，建立多个视图。 1234567891011// 创建一个8字节的ArrayBuffervar b = new ArrayBuffer(8);// 创建一个指向b的Int32视图，开始于字节0，直到缓冲区的末尾var v1 = new Int32Array(b);// 创建一个指向b的Uint8视图，开始于字节2，直到缓冲区的末尾var v2 = new Uint8Array(b, 2);// 创建一个指向b的Int16视图，开始于字节2，长度为2var v3 = new Int16Array(b, 2, 2); 对于以上代码，v1、v2和v3是重叠的：v1[0]是一个32位整数，指向字节0～字节3；v2[0]是一个8位无符号整数，指向字节2；v3[0]是一个16位整数，指向字节2～字节3。只要任何一个视图对内存有所修改，就会在另外两个视图上反应出来。 注意，byteOffset必须与所要建立的数据类型一致，否则会报错。 123var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);var i16 = new Int16Array(buffer, 1);// Uncaught RangeError: start offset of Int16Array should be a multiple of 2 上面代码中，新生成一个8个字节的ArrayBuffer对象，然后在这个对象的第一个字节，建立带符号的16位整数视图，结果报错。因为，带符号的16位整数需要两个字节，所以byteOffset参数必须能够被2整除。 如果想从任意字节开始解读ArrayBuffer对象，必须使用DataView视图，因为TypedArray视图只提供9种固定的解读格式。 TypedArray(length) 视图还可以不通过ArrayBuffer对象，直接分配内存而生成。 1234var f64a = new Float64Array(8);f64a[0] = 10;f64a[1] = 20;f64a[2] = f64a[0] + f64a[1]; TypedArray(typedArray) 类型化数组的构造函数，可以接受另一个视图实例作为参数。 1var typedArray = new Int8Array(new Uint8Array(4)); 上面代码中，Int8Array构造函数接受一个Uint8Array实例作为参数。 注意，此时生成的新数组，只是复制了参数数组的值，对应的底层内存是不一样的。新数组会开辟一段新的内存储存数据，不会在原数组的内存之上建立视图。 1234567var x = new Int8Array([1, 1]);var y = new Int8Array(x);x[0] // 1y[0] // 1x[0] = 2;y[0] // 1 上面代码中，数组y是以数组x为模板而生成的，当x变动的时候，y并没有变动。 如果想基于同一段内存，构造不同的视图，可以采用下面的写法。 1234567var x = new Int8Array([1, 1]);var y = new Int8Array(x.buffer);x[0] // 1y[0] // 1x[0] = 2;y[0] // 2 TypedArray(arrayLikeObject) 构造函数的参数也可以是一个普通数组，然后直接生成TypedArray实例。 1var typedArray = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]); 注意，这时TypedArray视图会重新开辟内存，不会在原数组的内存上建立视图。 上面代码从一个普通的数组，生成一个8位无符号整数的TypedArray实例。 TypedArray数组也可以转换回普通数组。 1var normalArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(typedArray); BYTES_PER_ELEMENT属性每一种视图的构造函数，都有一个BYTES_PER_ELEMENT属性，表示这种数据类型占据的字节数。 12345678Int8Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 1Uint8Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 1Int16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 2Uint16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 2Int32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 4Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 4Float32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 4Float64Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT // 8 ArrayBuffer与字符串的互相转换ArrayBuffer转为字符串，或者字符串转为ArrayBuffer，有一个前提，即字符串的编码方法是确定的。假定字符串采用UTF-16编码（JavaScript的内部编码方式），可以自己编写转换函数。 1234567891011121314// ArrayBuffer转为字符串，参数为ArrayBuffer对象function ab2str(buf) &#123; return String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint16Array(buf));&#125;// 字符串转为ArrayBuffer对象，参数为字符串function str2ab(str) &#123; var buf = new ArrayBuffer(str.length * 2); // 每个字符占用2个字节 var bufView = new Uint16Array(buf); for (var i = 0, strLen = str.length; i &lt; strLen; i++) &#123; bufView[i] = str.charCodeAt(i); &#125; return buf;&#125; TypedArray.prototype.set()TypedArray数组的set方法用于复制数组（正常数组或TypedArray数组），也就是将一段内容完全复制到另一段内存。 1234var a = new Uint8Array(8);var b = new Uint8Array(8);b.set(a); 上面代码复制a数组的内容到b数组，它是整段内存的复制，比一个个拷贝成员的那种复制快得多。set方法还可以接受第二个参数，表示从b对象哪一个成员开始复制a对象。 1234var a = new Uint16Array(8);var b = new Uint16Array(10);b.set(a, 2) 上面代码的b数组比a数组多两个成员，所以从b[2]开始复制。 TypedArray.prototype.subarray()subarray方法是对于TypedArray数组的一部分，再建立一个新的视图。 12345var a = new Uint16Array(8);var b = a.subarray(2,3);a.byteLength // 16b.byteLength // 2 subarray方法的第一个参数是起始的成员序号，第二个参数是结束的成员序号（不含该成员），如果省略则包含剩余的全部成员。所以，上面代码的a.subarray(2,3)，意味着b只包含a[2]一个成员，字节长度为2。 TypedArray.prototype.slice()TypeArray实例的slice方法，可以返回一个指定位置的新的TypedArray实例。 123let ui8 = Uint8Array.of(0, 1, 2);ui8.slice(-1)// Uint8Array [ 2 ] 上面代码中，ui8是8位无符号整数数组视图的一个实例。它的slice方法可以从当前视图之中，返回一个新的视图实例。 slice方法的参数，表示原数组的具体位置，开始生成新数组。负值表示逆向的位置，即-1为倒数第一个位置，-2表示倒数第二个位置，以此类推。 TypedArray.of()TypedArray数组的所有构造函数，都有一个静态方法of，用于将参数转为一个TypedArray实例。 12Float32Array.of(0.151, -8, 3.7)// Float32Array [ 0.151, -8, 3.7 ] TypedArray.from()静态方法from接受一个可遍历的数据结构（比如数组）作为参数，返回一个基于这个结构的TypedArray实例。 12Uint16Array.from([0, 1, 2])// Uint16Array [ 0, 1, 2 ] 这个方法还可以将一种TypedArray实例，转为另一种。 12var ui16 = Uint16Array.from(Uint8Array.of(0, 1, 2));ui16 instanceof Uint16Array // true from方法还可以接受一个函数，作为第二个参数，用来对每个元素进行遍历，功能类似map方法。 12345Int8Array.of(127, 126, 125).map(x =&gt; 2 * x)// Int8Array [ -2, -4, -6 ]Int16Array.from(Int8Array.of(127, 126, 125), x =&gt; 2 * x)// Int16Array [ 254, 252, 250 ] 上面的例子中，from方法没有发生溢出，这说明遍历是针对新生成的16位整数数组，而不是针对原来的8位整数数组。也就是说，from会将第一个参数指定的TypedArray数组，拷贝到另一段内存之中（占用内存从3字节变为6字节），然后再进行处理。 DataView如果一段数据包括多种类型（比如服务器传来的HTTP数据），这时除了建立ArrayBuffer对象的复合视图以外，还可以通过DataView视图进行操作。 DataView视图提供更多操作选项，而且支持设定字节序。本来，在设计目的上，ArrayBuffer对象的各种TypedArray视图，是用来向网卡、声卡之类的本机设备传送数据，所以使用本机的字节序就可以了；而DataView视图的设计目的，是用来处理网络设备传来的数据，所以大端字节序或小端字节序是可以自行设定的。 DataView视图本身也是构造函数，接受一个ArrayBuffer对象作为参数，生成视图。 1DataView(ArrayBuffer buffer [, 字节起始位置 [, 长度]]); 下面是一个例子。 12var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(24);var dv = new DataView(buffer); DataView实例有以下属性，含义与TypedArray实例的同名方法相同。 DataView.prototype.buffer：返回对应的ArrayBuffer对象 DataView.prototype.byteLength：返回占据的内存字节长度 DataView.prototype.byteOffset：返回当前视图从对应的ArrayBuffer对象的哪个字节开始 DataView实例提供8个方法读取内存。 getInt8：读取1个字节，返回一个8位整数。 getUint8：读取1个字节，返回一个无符号的8位整数。 getInt16：读取2个字节，返回一个16位整数。 getUint16：读取2个字节，返回一个无符号的16位整数。 getInt32：读取4个字节，返回一个32位整数。 getUint32：读取4个字节，返回一个无符号的32位整数。 getFloat32：读取4个字节，返回一个32位浮点数。 getFloat64：读取8个字节，返回一个64位浮点数。 这一系列get方法的参数都是一个字节序号（不能是负数，否则会报错），表示从哪个字节开始读取。 1234567891011var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(24);var dv = new DataView(buffer);// 从第1个字节读取一个8位无符号整数var v1 = dv.getUint8(0);// 从第2个字节读取一个16位无符号整数var v2 = dv.getUint16(1);// 从第4个字节读取一个16位无符号整数var v3 = dv.getUint16(3); 上面代码读取了ArrayBuffer对象的前5个字节，其中有一个8位整数和两个十六位整数。 如果一次读取两个或两个以上字节，就必须明确数据的存储方式，到底是小端字节序还是大端字节序。默认情况下，DataView的get方法使用大端字节序解读数据，如果需要使用小端字节序解读，必须在get方法的第二个参数指定true。 12345678// 小端字节序var v1 = dv.getUint16(1, true);// 大端字节序var v2 = dv.getUint16(3, false);// 大端字节序var v3 = dv.getUint16(3); DataView视图提供8个方法写入内存。 setInt8：写入1个字节的8位整数。 setUint8：写入1个字节的8位无符号整数。 setInt16：写入2个字节的16位整数。 setUint16：写入2个字节的16位无符号整数。 setInt32：写入4个字节的32位整数。 setUint32：写入4个字节的32位无符号整数。 setFloat32：写入4个字节的32位浮点数。 setFloat64：写入8个字节的64位浮点数。 这一系列set方法，接受两个参数，第一个参数是字节序号，表示从哪个字节开始写入，第二个参数为写入的数据。对于那些写入两个或两个以上字节的方法，需要指定第三个参数，false或者undefined表示使用大端字节序写入，true表示使用小端字节序写入。 12345678// 在第1个字节，以大端字节序写入值为25的32位整数dv.setInt32(0, 25, false);// 在第5个字节，以大端字节序写入值为25的32位整数dv.setInt32(4, 25);// 在第9个字节，以小端字节序写入值为2.5的32位浮点数dv.setFloat32(8, 2.5, true); 如果不确定正在使用的计算机的字节序，可以采用下面的判断方式。 12345var littleEndian = (function() &#123; var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(2); new DataView(buffer).setInt16(0, 256, true); return new Int16Array(buffer)[0] === 256;&#125;)(); BlobBlob 对象表示一个不可变、原始数据的类文件对象。Blob 表示的不一定是JavaScript原生格式的数据。File 接口基于Blob，继承了 blob 的功能并将其扩展使其支持用户系统上的文件。 要从其他非blob对象和数据构造一个Blob，请使用 Blob() 构造函数。要创建包含另一个blob数据的子集blob，请使用 slice()方法。要获取用户文件系统上的文件对应的Blob对象，请参阅 File文档。 从Blob中读取内容的唯一方法是使用 FileReader。以下代码将 Blob 的内容作为类型数组读取： 12345var reader = new FileReader();reader.addEventListener(&quot;loadend&quot;, function() &#123;

～/.ssh/authorized_keys 配置服务器的/etc/ssh/sshd_config，下面是一些建议的配置： 1234567891011121314151617vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config# 禁用root账户登录，非必要，但为了安全性，请配置PermitRootLogin no# 是否让 sshd 去检查用户家目录或相关档案的权限数据，# 这是为了担心使用者将某些重要档案的权限设错，可能会导致一些问题所致。# 例如使用者的 ~.ssh/ 权限设错时，某些特殊情况下会不许用户登入StrictModes no# 是否允许用户自行使用成对的密钥系统进行登入行为，仅针对 version 2。# 至于自制的公钥数据就放置于用户家目录下的 .ssh/authorized_keys 内RSAAuthentication yesPubkeyAuthentication yesAuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys#有了证书登录了，就禁用密码登录吧，安全要紧PasswordAuthentication no 然后不要忘记 sudo service sshd restart 一般来讲，这样就算是成功了，我们可以在客户端尝试： 1ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa remote_username@remote_ip 如果不行，可能是服务端或客户端相关 .ssh 文件权限不对，可以进行如下尝试： 123456服务端chown -R 0700 ~/.sshchown -R 0644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys客户端改一下chmod 600 id_rsa","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Linux/"},{"name":"ssh","slug":"ssh","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/ssh/"}]},{"title":"构建利用Proxy和Reflect实现双向数据绑定的微框架","slug":"构建利用Proxy和Reflect实现双向数据绑定的微框架","date":"2018-04-09T05:40:44.000Z","updated":"2019-04-15T00:17:48.443Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/04/08/构建利用Proxy和Reflect实现双向数据绑定的微框架/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/04/08/构建利用Proxy和Reflect实现双向数据绑定的微框架/","excerpt":"","text":"写在前面：这篇文章讲述了如何利用Proxy和Reflect实现双向数据绑定，个人系Vue早期玩家，写这个小框架的时候也没有参考Vue等源代码，之前了解过其他实现，但没有直接参考其他代码，如有雷同，纯属巧合。 代码下载地址：这里下载 综述关于Proxy和Reflect的资料推荐阮老师的教程:http://es6.ruanyifeng.com/ 这里不做过多介绍。 实现双向数据绑定的方法有很多，也可以参考本专栏之前的其他实现，我之所以选择用Proxy和Reflect，一方面是因为可以大量节约代码，并且简化逻辑，可以让我把更多的经历放在其他内容的构建上面，另外一方面本项目直接基于ES6，用这些内容也符合面向未来的JS编程规范，第三点最后说。 由于这个小框架是自己在PolarBear这个咖啡馆在一个安静的午后开始写成，暂且起名Polar，日后希望我能继续完善这个小框架，给添加上更多有趣的功能。 首先我们可以看整体功能演示：[一个gif动图，如果不能看，请点击这里的链接] 代码分析我们要做这样一个小框架，核心是要监听数据的改变，并且在数据的改变的时候进行一些操作，从而维持数据的一致。 我的思路是这样的： 将所有的数据信息放在一个属性对象中(this._data),之后给这个属性对象用Proxy包装set,在代理函数中我们更新属性对象的具体内容，同时通知所有监听者，之后返回新的代理对象(this.data)，我们之后操作的都是新的代理对象。 对于input等表单，我们需要监听input事件，在回调函数中直接设置我们代理好的数据对象，从而触发我们的代理函数。 我们同时也应该支持事件机制，这里我们以最常用的click方法作为例子实现。 下面开始第一部分，我们希望我们之后使用这个库的时候可以这样调用: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;label&gt;name:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input p-model = &quot;name&quot; /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;div&gt;name:&#123;&#123;name&#125;&#125; age:&#123;&#123;age&#125;&#125;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;i&gt;note:&#123;&#123;note&#125;&#125;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;button p-click=&quot;test(2)&quot;&gt;button1&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; var myPolar = new Polar(&#123; el:&quot;#app&quot;, data: &#123; name: &quot;niexiaotao&quot;, age:16, note:&quot;Student of Zhejiang University&quot; &#125;, methods:&#123; test:function(e,addNumber)&#123; console.log(&quot;e:&quot;,e); this.data.age+=Number(addNumber); &#125; &#125;&#125;);&lt;/script&gt; 没错，和Vue神似吧，所以这种调用方式应当为我们所熟悉。 我们需要建立一个Polar类，这个类的构造函数应该进行一些初始化操作: 12345678910 constructor(configs)&#123; this.root = this.el = document.querySelector(configs.el); this._data = configs.data; this._data.__bindings = &#123;&#125;; //创建代理对象 this.data = new Proxy(this._data, &#123;set&#125;); this.methods = configs.methods; this._compile(this.root);&#125; 这里面的一部份内容是直接将我们传入的configs按照属性分别赋值，另外就是我们创建代理对象的过程，最后的_compile方法可以理解为一个私有的初始化方法。 实际上我把剩下的内容几乎都放在_compile方法里面了，这样理解起来方便，但是之后可能要改动。 我们还是先不能看我们代理的set该怎么写，因为这个时候我们还要先继续梳理思路： 假设我们这样&lt;div&gt;name:&lt;/div&gt;将数据绑定到dom节点，这个时候我们需要做什么呢，或者说，我们通过什么方式让dom节点和数据对应起来，随着数据改变而改变。 看上文的__bindings。这个对象用来存储所有绑定的dom节点信息，__bindings本身是一个对象，每一个有对应dom节点绑定的数据名称都是它的属性，对应一个数组，数组中的每一个内容都是一个绑定信息，这样，我们在自己写的set代理函数中，我们一个个调用过去，就可以更新内容了： 123dataSet.__bindings[key].forEach(function(item)&#123; //do something to update...&#125;); 我这里创建了一个用于构造调用的函数，这个函数用于创建存储绑定信息的对象： 123456function Directive(el,polar,attr,elementValue)&#123; this.el=el;//元素本身dom节点 this.polar = polar;//对应的polar实例 this.attr = attr;//元素的被绑定的属性值，比如如果是文本节点就可以是nodeValue this.el[this.attr] = this.elementValue = elementValue;//初始化&#125; 这样，我们的set可以这样写: 12345678function set(target, key, value, receiver) &#123; const result = Reflect.set(target, key, value, receiver); var dataSet = receiver || target; dataSet.__bindings[key].forEach(function(item)&#123; item.el[item.attr] = item.elementValue = value; &#125;); return result;&#125; 接下来可能还有一个问题：我们的实际上只是节点的一部分，这并不是节点啊，另外我们是不是还可以这么写：&lt;div&gt;name: age:&lt;/div&gt;？ 关于这两个问题，前者的答案是我们将替换成一个文本节点，而为了应对后者的情况，我们需要将两个被绑定数据中间和前后的内容，都变成新的文本节点，然后这些文本节点组成文本节点串。(这里多说一句，html5的normalize方法可以将多个文本节点合并成一个，如果不小心调用了它，那我们的程序就要GG了) 所以我们在_compile函数首先： 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637var _this = this; var nodes = root.children; var bindDataTester = new RegExp(&quot;&#123;&#123;(.*?)&#125;&#125;&quot;,&quot;ig&quot;); for(let i=0;i&lt;nodes.length;i++)&#123; var node=nodes[i]; //如果还有html字节点，则递归 if(node.children.length)&#123; this._compile(node); &#125; var matches = node.innerHTML.match(bindDataTester); if(matches)&#123; var newMatches = matches.map(function (item) &#123; return item.replace(/&#123;&#123;(.*?)&#125;&#125;/,&quot;$1&quot;) &#125;); var splitTextNodes = node.innerHTML.split(/&#123;&#123;.*?&#125;&#125;/); node.innerHTML=null; //更新DOM，处理同一个textnode里面多次绑定情况 if(splitTextNodes[0])&#123; node.append(document.createTextNode(splitTextNodes[0])); &#125; for(let ii=0;ii&lt;newMatches.length;ii++)&#123; var el = document.createTextNode(&apos;&apos;); node.appendChild(el); if(splitTextNodes[ii+1])&#123; node.append(document.createTextNode(splitTextNodes[ii+1])); &#125; //对数据和dom进行绑定 let returnCode = !this._data.__bindings[newMatches[ii]]? this._data.__bindings[newMatches[ii]] = [new Directive(el,this,&quot;nodeValue&quot;,this.data[newMatches[ii]])] :this._data.__bindings[newMatches[ii]].push(new Directive(el,this,&quot;nodeValue&quot;,this.data[newMatches[ii]])) &#125; &#125; 这样，我们的数据绑定阶段就写好了，接下来，我们处理&lt;input p-model = &quot;name&quot; /&gt;这样的情况。 这实际上是一个指令，我们只需要当识别到这一个指令的时候，做一些处理，即可： 1234567891011121314if(node.hasAttribute((&quot;p-model&quot;)) &amp;&amp; node.tagName.toLocaleUpperCase()==&quot;INPUT&quot; || node.tagName.toLocaleUpperCase()==&quot;TEXTAREA&quot;)&#123; node.addEventListener(&quot;input&quot;, (function () &#123; var attributeValue = node.getAttribute(&quot;p-model&quot;); if(_this._data.__bindings[attributeValue]) _this._data.__bindings[attributeValue].push(new Directive(node,_this,&quot;value&quot;,_this.data[attributeValue])) ; else _this._data.__bindings[attributeValue] = [new Directive(node,_this,&quot;value&quot;,_this.data[attributeValue])]; return function (event) &#123; _this.data[attributeValue]=event.target.value &#125; &#125;)());&#125; 请注意，上面调用了一个IIFE，实际绑定的函数只有返回的函数那一小部分。 最后我们处理事件的情况：&lt;button p-click=&quot;test(2)&quot;&gt;button1&lt;/button&gt; 实际上这比处理p-model还简单，但是我们为了支持函数参数的情况，处理了一下传入参数，另外我实际上将event始终作为一个参数传递，这也许并不是好的实践，因为使用的时候还要多注意。 12345678910111213141516if(node.hasAttribute(&quot;p-click&quot;)) &#123; node.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;,function()&#123; var attributeValue=node.getAttribute(&quot;p-click&quot;); var args=/\\(.*\\)/.exec(attributeValue); //允许参数 if(args) &#123; args=args[0]; attributeValue=attributeValue.replace(args,&quot;&quot;); args=args.replace(/[\\(\\)\\&apos;\\&quot;]/g,&apos;&apos;).split(&quot;,&quot;); &#125; else args=[]; return function (event) &#123; _this.methods[attributeValue].apply(_this,[event,...args]); &#125; &#125;());&#125; 现在我们已经将所有的代码分析完了，是不是很清爽？代码除去注释约100行，所有源代码可以在这里下载。这当然不能算作一个框架了，不过可以学习学习，这学期有时间的话，还要继续完善，也欢迎大家一起探讨。 一起学习，一起提高，做技术应当是直接的，有问题欢迎指出～ 最后说的第三点：是自己还是一个学生，做这些内容也仅仅是出于兴趣，因为找暑期实习比较艰难，在等待鹅厂面试间隙写的这个程序，压压惊(然而并没有消息)。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"MVVM","slug":"MVVM","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/MVVM/"}]},{"title":"[PWA实践]serviceWorker生命周期、请求代理与通信","slug":"PWA实践-serviceWorker生命周期、请求代理与通信","date":"2018-02-11T06:05:43.000Z","updated":"2019-04-15T00:17:48.441Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/02/10/PWA实践-serviceWorker生命周期、请求代理与通信/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/02/10/PWA实践-serviceWorker生命周期、请求代理与通信/","excerpt":"","text":"本文主要讲 serviceWorker 生命周期和挂载、卸载等问题，适合对 serviceWorker 的作用有所了解但是具体细节不是特别清楚的读者 以下所有分析基于 Chrome V63 serviceWorker的挂载先来一段代码感受serviceWorker注册: 12345678910111213if (&apos;serviceWorker&apos; in navigator) &#123; window.addEventListener(&apos;load&apos;, function () &#123; navigator.serviceWorker.register(&apos;/sw.js&apos;, &#123;scope: &apos;/&apos;&#125;) .then(function (registration) &#123; // 注册成功 console.log(&apos;ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: &apos;, registration.scope); &#125;) .catch(function (err) &#123; // 注册失败:( console.log(&apos;ServiceWorker registration failed: &apos;, err); &#125;); &#125;);&#125; 通过上述代码，我们定义在/sw.js里的内容就会生效(对于当前页面之前没有 serviceWorker 的情况而言，我们注册的 serviceWorker 肯定会生效，如果当前页面已经有了我们之前注册的 serviceWorker，这个时候涉及到 serviceWorker的更新机制，下文详述) 如果我们在sw.js没有变化的情况下刷新这个页面，每次还是会有注册成功的回调以及相应的log输出，但是这个时候浏览器发现我们的 serviceWorker 并没有发生变化，并不会重置一遍 serviceWorker serviceWorker更新我们如果想更新一个 serviceWorker，根据我们的一般web开发策略，可能会想到以下几种策略： 仅变更文件名(比如把sw.js变成sw-v2.js或者加一个hash) 仅变更文件内容(仅仅更新sw.js的内容，文件名不变) 同时变更：同时执行以上两条 在这里，我可以很负责的告诉你，变更serviceWorker文件名绝对不是一个好的实践，浏览器判断 serviceWorker 是否相同基本和文件名没有关系，甚至有可能还会造成浏览器抛出404异常(因为找不到原来的文件名对应的文件了)。 所以我们只需要变更内容即可，实际上，我们每次打开或者刷新该页面，浏览器都会重新请求一遍 serviceWorker 的定义文件，如果发现文件内容和之前的不同了，这个时候: (下文中，我们使用“有关 tab”来表示受 serviceWorker 控制的页面，刷新均指普通刷新(F5/CommandR)并不指Hard Reload) 这个新的 serviceWorker 就会进入到一个 “waiting to activate” 的状态，并且只要我们不关闭这个网站的所有tab(更准确地说，是这个 serviceWorker 控制的所有页面)，新的 serviceWorker 始终不会进入替换原有的进入到 running 状态(就算我们只打开了一个有关 tab，直接刷新也不会让新的替换旧的)。 如果我们多次更新了 serviceWorker 并且没有关闭当前的 tab 页面，那么新的 serviceWorker 就会挤掉原先处于第二顺位(waiting to activate)的serviceWorker，变成waiting to activate状态 也就是说，我们只有关闭当前旧的 serviceWorker 控制的所有页面 的所有tab，之后浏览器才会把旧的 serviveWorker 移除掉，换成新的，再打开相应的页面就会使用新的了。 当然，也有一个特殊情况：如果我们在新的 serviceWorker 使用了self.skipWaiting();，像这样： 123self.addEventListener(&apos;install&apos;, function(event) &#123; self.skipWaiting();&#125;); 这个时候，要分为以下两种情况： 如果当前我们只打开了一个有关 tab，这个时候，我们直接刷新，发现新的已经替换掉旧的了。 如果我们当前打开了若干有关 tab，这个时候，无论我们刷新多少次，新的也不会替换掉旧的，只有我们一个一个关掉tab(或者跳转走)只剩下最后一个了，这个时候刷新，会让新的替换旧的(也就是上一种情况) Chrome 的这种机制，防止了同一个页面先后被新旧两个不同的 serviceWorker 接管的情况出现。 手动更新虽然说，在页面每次进入的时候浏览器都会检查一遍 serviceWorker 是否更新，但如果我们想要手动更新 serviceWorker 也没有问题： 1234navigator.serviceWorker.register(&quot;/sw.js&quot;).then(reg =&gt; &#123; reg.update(); // 或者 一段时间之后更新&#125;); 这个时候如果 serviceWorker 变化了，那么会重新触发 install 执行一遍 install 的回调函数，如果没有变，就不会触发这个生命周期。 install 生命周期钩子我们一般会在 sw.js 中，添加install的回调，一般在回调中，我们会进行缓存处理操作，像这样： 123456789101112self.addEventListener(&apos;install&apos;, function(event) &#123; console.log(&apos;[sw2] serviceWorker Installed successfully&apos;, event) event.waitUntil( caches.open(&apos;mysite-static-v1&apos;).then(function(cache) &#123; return cache.addAll([ &apos;/stylesheets/style.css&apos;, &apos;/javascripts/common.39c462651d449a73b5bb.js&apos;, ]); &#125;) )&#125; 如果我们新打开一个页面，如果之前有 serviceWorker，那么会触发install，如果之前没有， 那么在 serviceWorker 装载后会触发 install。 如果我们刷新页面，serviceWorker 和之前没有变化或者 serviceWorker 已经处在 waiting to activate，不会触发install，如果有变化，会触发install，但不会接管页面(上文中提到)。 activate 生命周期钩子activate 在什么时候被触发呢？ 如果当前页面没有 serviceworker ，那么会在 install 之后触发。 如果当前页面有 serviceWorker，并且有 serviceWorker更新，新的 serviceWorker 只会触发 install ，不会触发 activate 换句话说，当前变成 active 的 serviceWorker 才会被触发这个生命周期钩子 serviceWorker 代理请求serviceWorker 代理请求相对来说比较好理解，以下是一个很简单的例子： 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546self.addEventListener(&apos;install&apos;, function(event) &#123;

&#125;) );&#125;);self.addEventListener(&apos;fetch&apos;, function(event) &#123; console.log(&apos;Handling fetch event for&apos;, event.request.url); // console.log(&apos;[sw2]fetch but do nothing&apos;) event.respondWith( // caches.match() will look for a cache entry in all of the caches available to the service worker. // It&apos;s an alternative to first opening a specific named cache and then matching on that. caches.match(event.request).then(function(response) &#123; if (response) &#123; console.log(&apos;Found response in cache:&apos;, response); return response; &#125; console.log(&apos;No response found in cache. About to fetch from network...&apos;); // event.request will always have the proper mode set (&apos;cors, &apos;no-cors&apos;, etc.) so we don&apos;t // have to hardcode &apos;no-cors&apos; like we do when fetch()ing in the install handler. return fetch(event.request).then(function(response) &#123; console.log(&apos;Response from network is:&apos;, response); return response; &#125;).catch(function(error) &#123; // This catch() will handle exceptions thrown from the fetch() operation. // Note that a HTTP error response (e.g. 404) will NOT trigger an exception. // It will return a normal response object that has the appropriate error code set. console.error(&apos;Fetching failed:&apos;, error); throw error; &#125;); &#125;) );&#125;); 有两点要注意的： 我们如果这样代理了，哪怕没有 cache 命中，实际上也会在控制台写from serviceWorker，而那些真正由serviceWorker发出的请求也会显示，有一个齿轮图标，如下图： 第二点就是我们如果在 fetch 的 listener 里面 do nothing， 也不会导致这个请求直接假死掉的。 另外，通过上面的代码我们发现，实际上由于现在我们习惯给我们的文件资源加上 hash，所以我们基本上不可能手动输入需要缓存的文件列表，现在大多数情况下，我们都是借助 webpack 插件，完成这部分工作。 serviceWorker 和 页面之间的通信serviceWorker向页面发消息： 1234567891011121314sw.js:self.clients.matchAll().then(clients =&gt; &#123; clients.forEach(client =&gt; &#123; console.log(&apos;%c [sw message]&apos;, &apos;color:#00aa00&apos;, client) client.postMessage(&quot;This message is from serviceWorker&quot;) &#125;)&#125;)主页面:navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener(&apos;message&apos;, function (event) &#123; console.log(&apos;[Main] receive from serviceWorker:&apos;, event.data, event)&#125;); 当然，这里面是有坑的： 主界面的事件监听需要等serviceWorker注册完毕后，所以一般navigator.serviceWorker.register的回调到来之后再进行注册(或者延迟足够的时间)。 如果在主界面事件监听还没有注册成功的时候 serviceWorker 发送消息，自然是收不到的。如果我们把 serviceWorker 直接写在 install 的回调中，也是不能被正常收到的。 从页面向 serviceWorker 发送消息： 12345678主页面:navigator.serviceWorker.controller &amp;&amp; navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage(&apos;hello serviceWorker&apos;);sw.js:self.addEventListener(&apos;message&apos;, function (event) &#123; console.log(&quot;[sw from main]&quot;,event.data); // 输出：&apos;sw.updatedone&apos;&#125;); 同样的，这也要求主界面的代码需要等到serviceWorker注册完毕后触发，另外还有一点值得注意， serviceWorker 的事件绑定代码要求主界面的serviceWorker已经注册完毕后才可以。 也就是说，如果当前页面没有该serviceWorker 第一次注册是不会收到主界面接收到的消息的。 记住，只有当前已经在 active 的 serviceWorker， 才能和主页面收发消息等。 以上就是和 serviceWorker 有关的一些内容，在下一篇文章中，我会对PWA 添加至主屏幕等功能进行总结","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"PWA","slug":"PWA","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/PWA/"}]},{"title":"深入浏览器web渲染与优化-续","slug":"深入浏览器web渲染与优化-续","date":"2017-08-31T10:04:03.000Z","updated":"2019-04-15T00:17:48.443Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/08/31/深入浏览器web渲染与优化-续/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2017/08/31/深入浏览器web渲染与优化-续/","excerpt":"","text":"本篇文章接上一篇继续分析浏览器web渲染相关内容，但是更侧重优化工作。当然，主要还是基于X5来分析 上一篇文章我们主要是从浏览器内核的线程角度来分析相关工作的，对整体流程没有宏观清晰的分析，这次我们从宏观到微观，从整体到局部，来进行分析和探究可以优化的地方。 首先，一个网页的加载，需要什么工作呢？ 这个工作可以分为三部分：云(云端)、管(传输链路)、端(客户端)，从云经过管传到端，然后经过加载解析排版渲染，从而完成网页从请求到呈现的工作(当然，我们这里没有涉及协议的分析，实际上根据协议不同，这个传输可能是多次传输)。 数据到端之后，又经过以下过程，才最终显示出来： 在这个过程中，我们怎么衡量性能呢？ 固然，我们有诸多浏览器提供的API，这些API能让我们获取到较多信息并且记录上报： 但是这些具体数值表达的含义有限，并且他们实际上也不等于用户体验。 所以，找到一个科学并且可以检测的标准，并且这个标准可以和用户体验有正相关关系，这个是至关重要的。 目前这个标准是首屏时间(就之前自己的了解，具体的还区分首屏展示时间和首屏可交互时间，但是这里讲师不做区分，就下文提供的测算方法而言，显然这里指的是首屏展示时间，另外，展示后到用户的第一次操作都会有一个至少1s的延时，毕竟用户手指按下的动作是会比较慢的，这个时间js的交互都能完成了，所以首屏展示时间更加重要–from dorsywang) 那么首屏时间怎么测量呢？ 拿摄像机快速拍照测量的。这个答案可能有些吃惊，但是目前X5内核业务的相关开发人员的确就是采用这种方式测算的，通过高速相机不断拍照，然后辅助图像识别，判断首屏是否已经加载完成，最终再通过人工回归校对。因为如果采用程序检测的话，基本上都会对过程本身造成一定的影响，所以没有采用这种方式。当然，通过摄像+图像识别的这种方式也是有一定的弊端，比如说，假设首屏有一个图片，而图片的加载通常比较慢并且不影响css、js的加载，这个时候直接通过图片识别的话就可能会有一定的误判。 知道了怎么测算，那么接下来分析影响这个指标的一些原因： 资源阻塞内核线程 我们知道，一般情况下，css和JS是阻塞页面的，当然也会对首屏时间造成影响。 对这个问题，X5内核有关键子资源(阻塞资源)缓存，这里的关键资源，指的是内核经过统计判断得出的业务常用的关键子资源。 当然，这个统计也可能缺乏一定的准确性，所以相关团队也正在推进这方面的内容规范化(比如写入Web App Manifest) 中文Layout的时间过长 这个问题我之前没有听说过，但是的确是这样子，实际上，浏览器在绘制文字的时候经历的过程非常的多，其中有一个环节是找到文字的宽度和高度(因为在英文状态下，每一个字符的宽度是不同的，所以每一个字符都要查找，但是英文总共只有26个字符)，而中文由于字符比较多，常用得就有6000多个，完整的更是有2万个以上，所以这个过程需要花费更多的时间。 为了解决这个问题，X5内核考虑到中文文字几乎都是等宽等高的，所以这个过程对一个文字串来说只需要查询一次即可，实际上是节约了这个环节。 首次渲染太慢 为了解决这个问题，可以采用先绘制首屏的方式，这个也就是基于第一篇文章中讲到的浏览器的分块渲染机制 一次解析内容过多 采用首屏探测机制，优先解析首屏内容。 另外，这里可以前端配合去做首屏优化： 在首屏的位置插入首屏标签，内核解析到标签后立即终止解析并且排版上屏 1&lt;meta name=‘x5-pagetype’ content=‘optpage&apos;&gt; 然后在首屏分界的地方： 1&lt;first-screen/&gt; 有了这，可以专门去优化首屏标签之前的内容(这个标签前尽量展现耗时少和不需要阻塞解析的资源)。 另外，X5内核也提供了主资源预拉取的接口，并且考虑到预拉取的cookie问题，还提供了preconnect预链接。TIP:主资源中关联的子资源预拉取不用主动调用 预先操作 另外为了提供更加极致的优化，X5内核(QQ浏览器、手Q Webview)还提供了如下诸多预操作： 在”黏贴并转到”之前就开始进行网络请求和预渲染 经常访问的站点可以预解析DNS 点击地址栏时进行搜索预连接 点击链接时，先预链接，再做跳转。 …… 其他方式优化实际上上文主要讲了客户端方面的优化工作，实际上对于”云”、”管”两端，还是有很多优化工作可以讲的，但是由于这个和前端关系不是特别密切，我挑一部分讲一讲。这些在我们前端做个人项目的后台时候也可以参考 后台提速 直接使用IP，节省dns的查询时间 维持长连接 HTTP1.1启用包头节省 服务器缓存 文本资源压缩传输GZIP(6) 图片尺寸压缩、图片质量压缩、支持webp和sharpp/hevc格式。 降低网络时延 就快接入和就近接入 在选择接入点的时候，如果采用就近接入，可以保持路由稳定，有利于负载均衡，并且实现简单，便于维护。但是也有一定的缺点：经验判断，准确度不够高 ； 无法自动切换路由。 相比较而言，选择就快接入，是一个能够提效的方式。 内容防劫持运营商劫持对我们来说已经是不陌生的话题了，但是X5内核有一个比较新的防劫持手段，就是客户端和云加速服务器同时采用轻量级http加密，虽然这种方式普适性不强，但是的确可以解决腾讯自身业务的防劫持问题。 QUIC和http2QUIC 基于UDP的协议通讯方式，有这些优势： 延迟少 前向纠错 没有线头阻塞[注1]的多路复用 通信通道的定义基于ID而不是IP+端口，使得切换网络后继续转发链接成为可能 —————— 注1：线头阻塞： —————— 附1: 带宽和延迟对网页加载的影响：","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"性能优化","slug":"性能优化","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/性能优化/"}]},{"title":"深入浏览器web渲染与优化","slug":"深入浏览器web渲染与优化","date":"2017-08-27T08:37:22.000Z","updated":"2019-04-15T00:17:48.444Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/08/27/深入浏览器web渲染与优化/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2017/08/27/深入浏览器web渲染与优化/","excerpt":"","text":"本文主要分析和总结web内核渲染的相关内容，以及在这方面前端可以做的性能优化工作。 文章主要分为以下几个部分： blink内核的渲染机制 chrome内核架构变迁 分层渲染 动画 &amp; canvas &amp; WebGl 这里的前两部分可能会有些枯燥，如果是前端工程师并且想立即获得实际项目的建议的，可以直接阅读第三部分和第四部分 blink内核的渲染机制blink内核是Google基于Webkit内核开发的新的分支，而实际上，目前Chrome已经采用了blink内核，所以，我们接下来的有关分析大多基于blink内核的浏览器(Chrome)，就不再详细指明，当然，部分内容也会涉及到腾讯研发的X5内核(X5内核基于安卓的WebView，目前已经在手机QQ等产品中使用，基于X5内核的项目累计有数亿UV，上百亿PV)。 一个页面的显示，实际上主要经历了下面的四个流程： 加载 =&gt; 解析 =&gt; 排版 =&gt; 渲染 实际上，这里的渲染主要是指排版之后到最后的上屏绘制(这个时候内容已经排版好了)，一部分前端工程师通常会把一部分的排版工作理解到“渲染”的流程中(也就是下图中全部工作)，实际上这个理解是不准确的。 目前，浏览器的渲染采用的是分块渲染的机制，所谓的分块渲染的机制，其实应该这么理解： 浏览器首先把整个网页分成一些低分辨率的块，再把网页分成高分辨率的块，然后给这些块排列优先级。 处在可视区域内的低分辨率块的优先级会比较高，会被较先绘制。 之后浏览器会把高分辨率的块进行绘制，同样也是先绘制处于可视区域内的，再绘制可视区域外的(由近到远)。 以上讲的这些策略可以使可以使得浏览器优先展示可视区域内的内容，并且先展示大致内容，再展示高精度内容(当然，由于这个过程比较快，实际上我们大多时候是感受不到的)。 另外这里值得提醒的一点是，分块的优先级是会根据到可视区域的距离来决定的，所以有些横着的内容(比如banner的滚动实现，通常会设置横向超出屏幕来表示隐藏)，也是会按照到可视区域的距离来决定优先级的。 绘制的过程，可以被硬件加速，这里硬件加速的主要手段主要是指： 硬件加速合成上屏 2D Canvas、Video的硬件加速 GPU光栅化 GPU光栅化速度更快，内存和CPU的消耗更少 目前还没有办法对包含复杂矢量绘制的页面进行GPU光栅化 GPU光栅化是未来趋势 chrome内核架构变迁在渲染架构上，chrome也是经历了诸多变迁，早期的Chrome是这样的： 早期的chrome的架构实际上有以下缺点： Renderer线程任务繁重 无法实时响应缩放滑动操作 脏区域与滑动重绘区域有冲突 这里举个场景，假设一个gif，这个时候如果用户滑动，滑动新的需要绘制的内容和gif下一帧内容就会产生绘制冲突 当然，经过一系列的发展，Chrome现在是这样的： 在安卓上，Android 4.4的 Blink内核架构如下(4.4之前并不支持OpenGL) 当然，这种架构也有如下缺点： UI线程过于繁忙 无法支持Canvas的硬件加速以及WebGL 所以，后期发展成了这样： 总结看来，内核发展的趋势是： 多线程化(可以充分利用多核心CPU) 硬件加速(可以利用GPU) 分层渲染在阅读这一章之前，我建议读者先去亲自体验一下所谓的“分层渲染”： 打开Chrome浏览器，打开控制台，找到”Layers”，如果没有，那么在控制台右上角更多的图标-&gt;More tools 找到”Layers”，然后随便找个网页打开即可 网页的分层渲染流程主要是下面这样的： (注意：多个RenderObject可能又会对应一个或多个RenderLayer) 既然才用了分层渲染，那么肯定可以来分层处理，分层渲染有如下优点： 减少不必要的重新绘制 可以实现较为复杂的动画 能够方便实现复杂的CSS样式 当然，分层渲染是会很影响渲染效率的，可以有好的影响，使用不当也会有差的影响，我们需要合理的控制和使用分层： 如果小豆腐块分层较多，页面整体的分层数量较大，会导致每帧渲染时遍历分层和计算分层位置耗时较长啊(比较典型的是腾讯网移动端首页)。 如果可视区域内分层太多且需要绘制的面积太大，渲染性能非常差，甚至无法达到正常显示的地步(比如有一些全屏H5)。 如果页面几乎没有分层，页面变化时候需要重绘的区域较多。元素内容无变化只有位置发生变化的时候，可以利用分层来避免重绘。 那么，是什么原因可以导致分层呢？目前每一个浏览器或者不同版本的浏览器分层策略都是有些不同的(虽然总体差不太多)，但最常见的几个分层原因是：transform、Z-index；还有可以使用硬件加速的video、canvas；fixed元素；混合插件(flash等)。关于其他更具体的内容，可以见下文。 123456789//注:Chrome中符合创建新层的情况：Layer has 3D or perspective transform CSS properties(有3D元素的属性)Layer is used by &lt;video&gt; element using accelerated video decoding(video标签并使用加速视频解码)Layer is used by a &lt;canvas&gt; element with a 3D context or accelerated 2D context(canvas元素并启用3D)Layer is used for a composited plugin(插件，比如flash)Layer uses a CSS animation for its opacity or uses an animated webkit transform(CSS动画)Layer uses accelerated CSS filters(CSS滤镜)Layer with a composited descendant has information that needs to be in the composited layer tree, such as a clip or reflection(有一个后代元素是独立的layer)Layer has a sibling with a lower z-index which has a compositing layer (in other words the layer is rendered on top of a composited layer)(元素的相邻元素是独立layer) 最后，我们总结一下如何合理的设计分层：分层总的原则是，减少渲染重绘面积与减少分层个数和分层总面积： 相对位置会发生变化的元素需要分层(比如banner图、滚动条) 元素内容更新比较频繁的需要分层(比如页面中夹杂的倒计时等) 较长较大的页面注意总的分层个数 避免某一块区域分层过多，面积过大 (如果你给一个元素添加上了-webkit-transform: translateZ(0);或者 -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);属性，那么你就等于告诉了浏览器用GPU来渲染该层，与一般的CPU渲染相比，提升了速度和性能。(我很确定这么做会在Chrome中启用了硬件加速，但在其他平台不做保证。就我得到的资料而言，在大多数浏览器比如Firefox、Safari也是适用的)) 另外值得一提的是，X5对分层方面做了一定的优化工作，当其检测到分层过多可能会出现显示问题的时候会进行层合并，牺牲显示性能换取显示正确性。 最后再提出一个小问题： 以下哪种渲染方式是最优的呢？ 这里实际上后者虽然在分层上满足总体原则，但是之前讲到浏览器的分块渲染机制，是按照到可视区域的距离排序的，考虑到这个因素，实际上后者这种方式可能会对分块渲染造成一定的困扰，并且也不是最优的。 动画 &amp; canvas &amp; WebGl讲最后一部分开始，首先抛出一个问题：CSS动画 or JS动画? 对内核来说，实际上就是Renderer线程动画还是Compositor线程动画，二者实际上过程如下： 所以我们可以看出，Renderer线程是比Compositor线程动画性能差的(在中低端尤其明显) 另外，无论是JS动画还是CSS动画，动画过程中的重绘以及样式变化都会拖慢动画执行以及引起卡顿以下是一些不会触发重绘或者排版的CSS动画属性： cursor font-variant opacity orphans perspective perspecti-origin pointer-events transform transform-style widows 想要了解更多内容，可以参考这里 这方面最终的建议参考如下： 尽量使用不会引起重绘的CSS属性动画，例如transform、opacity等 动画一定要避免触发大量元素重新排版或者大面积重绘 在有动画执行时，避免其他动画不相关因素引起排版和重绘 requestAnimationFrame另外当我们在使用动画的时候，为了避免出现掉帧的情况，最好采用requestAnimationFrame这个API，这个API迎合浏览器的流程，并且能够保证在下一帧绘制的时候上一帧一定出现了： 3D canvas还有值得注意的是，有的时候我们需要涉及大量元素的动画(比如雪花飘落、多个不规则图形变化等)，这个时候如果用CSS动画，Animation动画的元素很多。，导致分层个数非常多，浏览器每帧都需要遍历计算所有分层，导致比较耗时、 这个时候该怎么办呢？ 2D canvas上场。 和CSS动画相比，2D canvas的优点是这样的： 硬件加速渲染 渲染流程更优 其渲染流程如下： 实际上以上流程比较耗时的是JS Call这一部分，执行opengl的这一部分还是挺快的。 HTML 2D canvas 主要绘制如下三种元素： 图片 文字 矢量 这个过程可以采用硬件加速，硬件加速图片绘制的主要流程： 硬件加速文字绘制的主要流程： 但对于矢量绘制而言，简单的图形，比如点、直线等可以直接使用OpenGL渲染，复杂的图形，如曲线等，无法采用OpenGL绘制。 对于绘制效率来说，2D Canvas对绘制图片效率较高，绘制文字和矢量效率较低(所以建议是，我们如果能使用贴图就尽量使用贴图了) 还有，有的时候我们需要先绘制到离屏canvas上面，然后再上屏，这个可以充分利用缓存。 3D canvas(WebGL)目前，3D canvas(WebGL)的应用也越来越多，对于这类应用，现在已经有了不少已经成型的庫: 通用引擎：threeJS、Pixi VR视频的专业引擎：krpano、UtoVR H5游戏引擎：Egret、Layabox、Cocos WebGL虽然包含Web，但本身对前端的要求最低，但是对OpenGL、数学相关的知识要求较高，所以如果前端工程师没有一定的基础，还是采用现在的流行庫。 X5内核对于WebGl进行了性能上和耗电上的优化，并且也对兼容性错误上报和修复做了一定的工作。 本文参考腾讯内部讲座资料整理而成，并融入一部分笔者的补充，谢绝任何形式的转载。 其他优质好文： Javascript高性能动画与页面渲染","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"性能优化","slug":"性能优化","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/性能优化/"}]}]}
